## 2. Background
The dataset is a year 2023 compilation of tech job postings from various countries done by Luke Barousse and can be found in [sql_course](https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql).
The dataset consists of three major tables containing information about the job postings and their required skills needed in these roles. Below are the major tables with some of the contained columns;
Job_postings_fact: job_id, job_location, job_title, job_country, salary_year_avg e.t.c
Skills_dim: skill_id, skill and type
Skills_job_dim: job_id, skill_id.
The Sql queries will answer the following questions:
1)	Top paying Data Analyst roles in the Netherlands
2)	Most in-demand skills for these top roles in the Netherlands
3)	The average yearly salary for the most in-demand skills for these top Data analyst roles in the Netherlands.

#### Tools Used 
SQL: programming language used to manipulate and manage the database
Postgres: The relational database management system that was used in storing and querying the structured data 
Visual studio Code: code editor used in executing the Sql queries and managing the database.
Git and Github: Used in version control and sharing of the Sql scripts and analysis creating room for collaboration and project tracking. 

## 3. Analysis
In this part of the project, we intend to answer all the questions in line with meeting the set objectives. We will show the various queries done on the dataset which are needed to investigate the various job positions in other to properly answer the research questions.

#### a. Top paying Data Analyst roles in the Netherlands
In identifying the top paying Data Analyst roles in the Netherlands, the job_postings _facts table was queried for information about Data Analyst job postings specifically for the Netherlands and a Left Join command was used to include the company_dim table in other to include the column containing company names in the result. Result filtering was done to remove all entries with NULL on the salary_year_avg column and another filtering to get the needed result columns.  

``` Sql
SELECT 
        job_id,
        job_title_short,
        job_location,
        job_schedule_type,
        salary_year_avg,
        job_posted_date,
        name AS company_name
    FROM job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim
    On job_postings_fact.company_id=company_dim.company_id
    WHERE 
        job_title_short LIKE '%Data Analyst%' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
        job_location ='Netherlands';
```

#### b. Most in-demand skills for these top roles in the Netherlands
The most in-demand skills for Data Analyst roles in the Netherlands were investigated by building on the above query for top paying Data Analyst roles. The skills_job_dim table, the skills_dim table and the resulting table from the above query were all joined so as to capture the skill_id and skills columns containing skills information for each job postings.  A count of all the job postings was done and grouped by the skills and skill_id columns to show each skill with their respective number of job postings.

``` sql

SELECT 
skill_id,
skills,
COUNT(*) AS job_count
FROM (
SELECT 
dutch_job.job_title_short,
job_location,
salary_year_avg,
company_name,
skills,
skills_dim.skill_id,
dutch_job.job_id
FROM 
(
    SELECT 
        job_id,
        job_title_short,
        job_location,
        job_schedule_type,
        salary_year_avg,
        job_posted_date,
        name AS company_name
    FROM job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim
    On job_postings_fact.company_id=company_dim.company_id
    WHERE 
        job_title_short LIKE '%Data Analyst%' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
        job_location ='Netherlands'
) AS dutch_job
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim 
ON dutch_job.job_id=skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim 
ON skills_job_dim.skill_id=skills_dim.skill_id
) AS high_demand
GROUP BY skill_id, skills
ORDER BY job_count DESC; 

```

|-------------|----------|
| cognos      | 1        |
| SQL         | 1        |
| R           | 1        |

job_location,
salary_year_avg,
company_name,
skills,
skills_dim.skill_id,
dutch_job.job_id

        name AS company_name
    FROM job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim
    On job_postings_fact.company_id=company_dim.company_id
    WHERE 
        job_title_short LIKE '%Data Analyst%' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
        job_location ='Netherlands'
) AS dutch_job
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim 
ON dutch_job.job_id=skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim 
ON skills_job_dim.skill_id=skills_dim.skill_id
) AS high_demand
GROUP BY skill_id, skills
ORDER BY job_count, avg_salary DESC;
